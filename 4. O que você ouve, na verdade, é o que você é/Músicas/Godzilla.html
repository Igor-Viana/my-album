        <p>Ugh, you're a monster<br>
            I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla<br>
            Better hit the deck like the card dealer<br>
            My whole squad's in here, walkin' around the party<br>
            A cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby<br>
            The Brain Heenan which is probably the<br>
            Same reason I wrestle with mania<br>
            Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up<br>
            Consider it to cross me a costly mistake<br>
            If they sleepin' on me, the<br>
            Hoes better get insomnia, ADHD, hydroxycut<br>
            Pass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)<br>
            In AA, with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate<br>
            Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday<br>
            This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, h-a, h-a, h-a<br>
            Laughin' all the way to the bank, I spray flames<br>
            They cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)<br>
            Monster<br>
            You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)<br>
            I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (Yeah)<br>
            When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers<br>
            I look like a villain outta those blockbusters<br>
            Godzilla, fire spitter, monster<br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet<br>
            Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster<br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet<br>
            I'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls<br>
            Had 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off<br>
            It's impossible to list 'em all<br>
            And in the midst of all this<br>
            I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball<br>
            Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?<br>
            Risperdal, voices whisper<br>
            But my fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn<br>
            This is just the song to go ballistic on<br>
            You just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher<br>
            I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological<br>
            Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of Vodka<br>
            When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a<br>
            Monster<br>
            You get in my way? I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)<br>
            I'm normal during the day, but at night turn to a monster (Yeah)<br>
            When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers<br>
            I look like a villain outta those blockbusters<br>
            Godzilla, fire spitter, monster<br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet<br>
            Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster<br>
            Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet<br>
            If you never gave a damn, raise your hand<br>
            'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans<br>
            I'm on point, like my index is, so all you will ever get is<br>
            The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('xam)<br>
            How can I have all these fans and perspire?<br>
            Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire<br>
            And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire<br>
            These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier<br>
            I got 'em passin' out like what you do, when you hand someone flyers<br>
            What goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw<br>
            'Cause I caught the flaps of my dollar stack<br>
            Right off the bat like a baseball, like Kid Ink<br>
            Bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy<br>
            'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake)<br>
            Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher<br>
            Won't even lend you an ear ain't even pretendin' to care<br>
            But I tell a bitch I'll marry her, if she'll bury her<br>
            Face on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez<br>
            Christian Rivera '<br>
            'Cause my lyrics never sit well so they wanna give me the chair<br>
            Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Carry<br>
            'Cause every Tom and Dick and Harry<br>
            Carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary<br>
            Got 'em swearin' up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious<br>
            It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column<br>
            We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem<br>
            Get the shaft out like a steering column (Mark Jack)<br>
            Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink<br>
            Evil half of the Bad Meets<br>
            Evil, that means take a back seat<br>
            Take it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single<br>
            Look at my rap sheets, what attracts these people<br>
            Is my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle<br>
            I stack these chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto<br>
            Fill 'em with the venom, and eliminate 'em<br>
            Other words, I Minute Maid 'em<br>
            I don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage<br>
            I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him<br>
            I'm finna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in a lake<br>
            Obliteratin' everything, incineratin' and renegade 'em<br>
            And I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid<br>
            But don't nobody want it but they're gonna get it anyway<br>
            'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill<br>
            I'm Atilla, kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla<br>
            You're bringin' the killer within me, out of me<br>
            You don't want to be the enemy of the demon<br>
            Who went in me, and be on the recieving of me, what stupidity, it'd be<br>
            Every bit of me is the epitome of a spitter<br>
            When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck<br>
            Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me<br>
            A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me<br>
            I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable<br>
            You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable<br>
            I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable<br>
            I'm on the toilet bowl<br>
            I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full<br>
            I'm not afraid to pull the<br>
            Man stop<br>
            Look what I'm plannin' (Haha)</p>
