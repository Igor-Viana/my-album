            Couple plaques, ayy<br>
            That's a fact, ayy<br>

            Throw it back, ayy<br>
            And this one is for the champions<br>
            I ain't lost since I began, yeah<br>
            Funny how you said it was the end, yeah<br>
            Then I went did it again, yeah<br>
            I told you long ago, on the road<br>
            I got what they waitin' for<br>
            I don't run from nothin', dog<br>
            Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low<br>
            You was never really rootin' for me anyway<br>
            When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say<br>
            He don't run from nothin', dog<br>
            Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over<br>
            Uh, need to, uh<br>
            Need to get this album done<br>
            Need a couple number ones<br>
            Need a plaque on every song<br>
            Need me like one with Nicki now<br>
            Tell a rap nigga, &quot;I don't see ya&quot;, ha<br>
            I'm a pop nigga like Bieber, ha<br>
            I don't fuck bitches, I'm queer, ha<br>
            But these niggas bitches like Madea<br>
            Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)<br>
            Ayy, oh, let's do it<br>
            I ain't fall off, I just ain't release my new shit<br>
            I blew up now everybody tryna sue me<br>
            You call me Nas, but the hood call me Doobie, yeah<br>
            And this one is for the champions<br>
            I ain't lost since I began, yeah<br>
            Funny how you said it was the end, yeah<br>
            Then I went did it again, yeah<br>
            I told you long ago, on the road<br>
            I got what they waitin' for (I got what they waitin' for)<br>
            I don't run from nothin', dog<br>
            Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low<br>
            (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)<br>
            You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)<br>
            When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say (like, ooh-ooh)<br>
            He don't run from nothin', dog<br>
            Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over<br>
            My track record so clean<br>
            They couldn't wait to just bash me<br>
            I must be gettin' too flashy<br>
            Y'all shouldn't have let the world gas me (woo)<br>
            It's too late 'cause I'm here to stay<br>
            And these girls know that I'm nasty (mm)<br>
            I sent her back to her boyfriend<br>
            With my handprint on her ass cheek<br>
            City talkin', we takin' notes<br>
            Tell 'em all to keep makin' posts<br>
            Wish he could but he can't get close<br>
            OG so proud of me that he chokin' up while he makin' toasts<br>
            I'm the type that you can't control<br>
            Said I would then I made it so (so)<br>
            I don't clear up rumors (ayy)<br>
            Where's y'all sense of humor? (Ayy)<br>
            I'm done makin' jokes 'cause they got old like baby boomers<br>
            Turn my haters to consumers<br>
            I make vets feel like they juniors (juniors)<br>
            Say your time is comin' soon but just like Oklahoma (mm)<br>
            Mine is comin' sooner (mm)<br>
            I'm just a late bloomer (mm)<br>
            I didn't peak in high school, I'm still out here gettin' cuter (woo)<br>
            All these social networks and computers<br>
            Got these pussies walkin' 'round like they ain't losers (losers)<br>
            I told you long ago, on the road<br>
            I got what they waitin' for (I got what they waitin' for)<br>
            I don't run from nothin', dog<br>
            Get your soldiers, tell 'em I ain't layin' low<br>
            (Bitch, I ain't runnin' from no one)<br>
            You was never really rootin' for me anyway (like, ooh-ooh)<br>
            When I'm back up at the top I wanna hear you say (like, ooh-ooh)<br>
            He don't run from nothin', dog<br>
            Get your soldiers, tell 'em that the break is over<br>
            Yeah<br>
            I'm the industry baby, mm<br>
