        Ooh, yeah, he mad <br>
I'm racking up white diamonds <br>
Throw me in the sky <br>
You would swear the sun shining <br>
Ooh, yeah, he mad <br>
I'm racking up white diamonds <br>
Throw me in the sky <br>
You would swear the sun shining <br>
In this gothic underground city, we all sin <br>
If I bring a couple rounds with me then we all win <br>
I came back and brought the crown with me, the king's den <br>
Break your Nexus and your neck 'cause <br>
Everybody's on your head <br>
I might, just might kick your butt <br>
Go run amok then paint my nails <br>
Never learned to raise my hand <br>
Was too busy raising hell <br>
Everything I know I am <br>
You should go and save yourself <br>
Thought you had my number, huh? <br>
Congratulations you played yourself <br>
Underground utopia dynasties and dystopia <br>
Fear is never an option so dying's not a real phobia <br>
I'm beating the odds <br>
Rising to every occasion as if I defeated the gods <br>
Switch up the mod <br>
Nothing but champions comin' up rolled in one little squad <br>
Hold still while I bag that, uh <br>
Talk bad 'til I snap back, uh <br>
This ain't brown this that dark black <br>
This that pitch black, jet black <br>
Snap yo' ex watch me give him flashbacks <br>
Pressure's rising fast as lighting they can't stop it now <br>
If you ain't talking realness then just change the topic now <br>
They laughing at the top like they can't see the bottom <br>
And they thought I needed help but I got here without them <br>
I am sharper than a pack of hundred razor blades <br>
When the smoke clears, outta her, bet they name gon' fade <br>
I'ma be here doing it, doing it my way <br>
They said I should I change it up <br>
But what did I say? <br>
Ooh, yeah, he mad <br>
I'm racking up white diamonds <br>
Throw me in the sky <br>
You would swear the sun shining <br>
Ooh, yeah, he mad <br>
I'm racking up white diamonds <br>
Throw me in the sky <br>
You would swear the sun shining <br>
Hold still while I bag that, uh <br>
Talk bad 'til I snap back, uh <br>
This ain't brown this that dark black <br>
This that pitch black, jet black <br>
Snap yo' ex watch me give him flashbacks <br>
I get that magic all on me, I feel like I'm Tracy McGrady <br>
Enemies circled around me three-sixty, T count 'em one-eighty <br>
I've been in court with the spirit beside me since I was a baby <br>
Just getting chaotic y'all made me a product for <br>
causing the chaos right here where they raised me <br>
In this gothic underground city, we all sin <br>
If I bring a couple rounds with me then we all win <br>
I came back and brought the crown with me, the king's den <br>
Break your Nexus and your neck 'cause <br>
Everybody's on your head <br>
Ooh, yeah, he mad <br>
I'm racking up white diamonds <br>
Throw me in the sky <br>
You would swear the sun shining <br>
Ooh, yeah, he mad <br>
I'm racking up white diamonds <br>
Throw me in the sky <br>
You would swear the sun shining <br>
Dynasties and dystopia, dynasties and dystopia <br>
Dynasties and dystopia, dynasties and dystopia <br>
Dynasties and dystopia, dynasties and dystopia <br>
