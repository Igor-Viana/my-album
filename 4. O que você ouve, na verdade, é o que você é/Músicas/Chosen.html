        Will I be myself again? <br>
        Where does it end? <br>
        And where does it begin? <br>
        'Cause, I don't know <br>
        What I did that made me <br><br>
        Chosen, by a force beyond control <br>
        Beyond remorse <br>
        And, I don't know <br>
        If I will make it through this <br>
        Losing who I am <br><br>
        A mind without a home <br>
        Leaving behind <br>
        The comfort that I've known <br>
        Where do I roam? <br>
        A stranger to myself <br>
        Born to be near <br>
        But living somewhere else <br><br>
        And I'm searching for the reasons I've been <br><br>
        Chosen by a force beyond control <br>
        Beyond remorse <br>
        Then I don't know <br>
        If I will make it through this <br>
        Losing who I am <br><br>
        Let me out (let me out) <br>
        Let me out (let me out) <br>
        Let me out (let me out) <br><br>
        Losing everything I've got human <br>
        Free will is miles away <br>
        I heard you play <br>
        In the digital Calvary <br>
        But I'm okay <br>
        I won't disobey <br><br>
        If you take me by the hand and make me <br><br>
        Chosen, by a force beyond control <br>
        I'll play a part if you make me whole <br>
        You'll be my voice <br>
        I'll be your soul <br>
        You'll take my choice <br>
        Then I don't know <br>
        How you will make me new <br>
        But this is who I am
