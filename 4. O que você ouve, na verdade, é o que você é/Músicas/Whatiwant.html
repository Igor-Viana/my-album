        <p>Quarter to two and I haven't got out of bed<br>
            Phone keeps buzzing but I'm leaving my messages unread<br>
            Sick in the head<br>
            Another day, another dread<br>
            Feel half dead<br>
            My mind is cloudy, my limbs are lead<br>
            A lack of seratonin control<br>
            A scar that sits on the soul<br>
            I'm having fits<br>
            Like opposites are dividing the whole<br>
            Taking a toll<br>
            For me that's just another day<br>
            And if you ask me how I'm doing<br>
            I will tell you that I'm OK<br>
            Feeling hazy<br>
            And I'm losing my control<br>
            And I can't get out this hole<br>
            And my world is getting cold<br>
            And I want you<br>
            But I think you might hate me<br>
            I tell myself I'm not going crazy<br>
            But I don't know what to do<br>
            And I don't think I'll get through<br>
            If I end up losing you<br>
            But I want to<br>
            Forgot I need your help<br>
            I'm not being myself at all<br>
            Another call<br>
            It's a crisis and it's all up to me<br>
            And not a thanks for staying through all the instability<br>
            With no apology<br>
            I can't unlock a mental block that has no key<br>
            I'm granting wishes that are taken for free<br>
            And for granted<br>
            You can't grow if no seed can be planted<br>
            Try to live and deal with rants until my words are recanted<br>
            For me, I just gotta take it day by day<br>
            And if you ask me how I'm doing, I will tell you that I'm OK<br>
            Feeling hazy<br>
            And I'm losing my control<br>
            And I can't get out this hole<br>
            And my world is getting cold<br>
            And I want you<br>
            But I think you might hate me<br>
            I tell myself I'm not going crazy<br>
            But I don't know what to do<br>
            And I don't think I'll get through<br>
            If I end up losing you<br>
            But I want to<br>
            Forgot I need your help<br>
            I'm not being myself at all<br>
            I wanna sing and make songs<br>
            I wanna dance all day long<br>
            I wanna be a big part of a big corporation<br>
            I wanna sing and make songs<br>
            I wanna dance all day long and all the night<br>
            I wanna sing and make songs<br>
            I wanna dance all day long<br>
            I wanna be a big part of a big corporation<br>
            I wanna sing and make songs<br>
            I wanna dance all day long and all the night<br>
            I wanna sing and make songs<br>
            I wanna dance all day long<br>
            I wanna be a big part of a big corporation<br>
            I wanna sing and make songs<br>
            I wanna dance all day long and all the night<br>
            Dance all day long and all the night<br>
            Dance all day long and all the night<br>
            I wanna be famous<br>
            And I want everyone to love me<br>
            Dance all day long and all the night<br>
            Dance all day long and all the night<br>
            I wanna be famous<br>
            And I want everyone to love me<br>
            Dance all day long and all the night<br>
            Dance all day long and all the night<br>
