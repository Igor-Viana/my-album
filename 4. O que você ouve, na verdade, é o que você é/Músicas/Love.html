        <p>I don't get the love I need anymore<br>
            I don't get the love I need anymore<br>
            I'm feelin' sick of independence<br>
            I don't get the love I need anymore<br>
            I don't get the love, I walked out the door<br>
            Oh, won't let you carry out my sentence<br>
            Well the writing was clear, it appeared on the wall<br>
            We were broken and scared unprepared for the fall<br>
            It's true, I couldn't keep waiting on you<br>
            And I know that you hurt and I know that you tried<br>
            But I'll go it alone if I can't satisfy your view<br>
            Why live a life I wasn't meant to?<br>
            But they told me, &quot;Dance<br>
            Keep playin' the game<br>
            Press start, continue, look<br>
            Within' you, without you<br>
            Begin to advance<br>
            As far as you can<br>
            'Til you lose your winnings<br>
            Find new beginnings&quot;<br>
            Na-na-na na-na-na<br>
            I don't get the love I need anymore<br>
            I'm cast out to sea, I can't find the shore<br>
            Don't really know what I was thinking<br>
            I don't get the love I need anymore<br>
            I'm not even sure what I'm searching for<br>
            I hear a melody and I start singing<br>
            I am lost in a dream, I can't open my eyes<br>
            Never told how to live after I say goodbye to you<br>
            They tell me, &quot;Find another darling&quot;<br>
            How can I find a love when I can't find myself?<br>
            When they set me adrift, made me think when I jumped<br>
            I flew but this just feels like I am falling<br>
            And they told me, &quot;Dance<br>
            Follow the rules<br>
            The next objective<br>
            Feel defective, select<br>
            A brand new circumstance<br>
            Make lovers of fools<br>
            Go through the motions<br>
            To feel connected<br>
            Without them you're broken, broken, broken, broken&quot;</p>
