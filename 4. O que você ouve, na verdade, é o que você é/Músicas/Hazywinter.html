        <p>Time, time, time<br>
            See what's become of me<br>
            Time, time, time<br>
            See what's become of me<br>
            While I looked around<br>
            For my possibilities<br>
            I was so hard to please<br>
            Look around<br>
            Leaves are brown<br>
            And the sky<br>
            Is a hazy shade of winter<br>
            Hear the Salvation Army Band<br>
            Down by the riverside<br>
            It's bound to be a better ride<br>
            Than what you've got planned<br>
            Carry a cup in your hand<br>
            Look around<br>
            Leaves are brown<br>
            And the sky<br>
            Is a hazy shade of winter<br>
            Hang onto your hopes my friend<br>
            That's an easy thing to say<br>
            But if your hopes should pass away<br>
            Simply pretend<br>
            That you can build them again<br>
            Look around<br>
            Grass is high<br>
            Fields are ripe<br>
            It's the springtime of my life<br>
            Seasons change with their scenery<br>
            Weaving time in a tapestry<br>
            Won't you stop and remember me?<br>
            Look around<br>
            Leaves are brown<br>
            And the sky<br>
            Is a hazy shade of winter<br>
            Look around<br>
            Leaves are brown<br>
            There's a patch of snow on the ground<br>
            Look around<br>
            Leaves are brown<br>
            There's a patch of snow on the ground<br>
            Look around<br>
            Leaves are brown<br>
            There's a patch of snow on the ground<br>
