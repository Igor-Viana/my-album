        <p>'Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak<br>
            And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up<br>
            But you got to search within you, and try to find that inner strength<br>
            And just pull that shit out of you<br>
            And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter<br>
            No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse<br>
            'Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em<br>
            'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em<br>
            'Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em<br>
            And I am not Hip-Hop and I'm just not Eminem<br>
            Subliminal thoughts, when I'mma stop sending 'em?<br>
            Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom<br>
            Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop<br>
            Amoxicillin's just not real enough<br>
            The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain<br>
            A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners<br>
            You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it<br>
            Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us<br>
            You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock<br>
            Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up?<br>
            For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up<br>
            You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!<br>
            'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out<br>
            'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>
            'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<br>
            I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse<br>
            'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out<br>
            'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>
            'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<br>
            I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse<br>
            Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get<br>
            When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit<br>
            This is your moment, and every single minute you spend<br>
            Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again<br>
            So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can<br>
            And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end<br>
            Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in<br>
            I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in<br>
            It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie<br>
            Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me<br>
            But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy<br>
            So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me<br>
            That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me<br>
            Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me<br>
            You hate it but you know respect you got to give me<br>
            The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me<br>
            'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out<br>
            'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>
            'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<br>
            I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse<br>
            'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out<br>
            'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>
            'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<br>
            I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse<br>
            Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart<br>
            What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart<br>
            And it's absurd, how people hang on every word<br>
            I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve<br>
            But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved<br>
            If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first<br>
            'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse<br>
            That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse<br>
            My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict<br>
            I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers<br>
            But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles<br>
            The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers<br>
            So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em<br>
            The track is on some battling raps who want some static?<br>
            'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters<br>
            A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so<br>
            'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out<br>
            'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>
            'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<br>
            I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse<br>
            'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out<br>
            'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth<br>
            'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps<br>
            I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse<br>
            Until the roof<br>
            (Until the roof)<br>
            The roof comes off<br>
            (The roof comes off)<br>
            Until my legs<br>
            (Until my legs)<br>
            Give out from underneath me<br>
            I will not fall, I will stand tall<br>
            Feels like no one can beat me<br>
