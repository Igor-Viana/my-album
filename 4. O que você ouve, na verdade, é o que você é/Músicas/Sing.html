        It's late in the evening <br>
Glass on the side <br>
I've been sat with you <br> 
For most of the night <br>
Ignoring everybody here <br> 
We wish they would disappear <br>
So maybe we could get down now <br><br>
I don't wanna know <br>
If you're getting ahead of the program <br>
I want you to be mine, lady <br>
To hold your body close <br>
Take another step into the no-man's land <br>
For the longest time lady <br><br>
I need you darling <br>
Come on set the tone <br>
If you feel you're falling <br>
Won't you let me know <br><br>
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh <br>
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh <br><br>
If you love me <br>
Come on, get involved <br>
Feel it rushing through you <br>
From your head to toe <br><br>
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh <br>
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh <br><br>
Sing! <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Louder! <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Sing! <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br><br>
This love is a blaze <br>
I saw flames from the side of the stage <br>
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days <br>
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know <br>
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke <br>
Let it go until our roads are changed <br>
Singing we found love in a local rave <br>
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say <br>
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray <br>
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya." <br>
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila. <br>
I already know she's a keeper <br>
Just from this one small act of kindness <br>
I'm in deep shit if anybody finds out <br>
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not <br>
Sobering up we just sit on the couch <br>
One thing led to another <br>
Now she's kissing my mouth <br><br>
I need you darling <br>
Come on set the tone <br>
If you feel you're falling <br>
Won't you let me know <br><br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh <br><br>
If you love me <br>
Come on, get involved <br>
Feel it rushing through you <br>
From your head to toe <br><br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh <br><br>
Sing! <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Louder! <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br>
Sing! <br>
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh <br><br>
Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance <br>
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back <br>
Can you feel it? <br>
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling <br>
Before the beat kicks in again <br>
Can you feel it? <br>
Can you feel it? <br>
Sing! <br>
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) <br>
I need you darling <br>
Come on set the tone <br>
If you feel you're falling <br>
Won't you let me know <br>
Louder! <br>
Sing! <br>
If you love me come on get involved <br>
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe <br>
Louder! <br>
Sing!
